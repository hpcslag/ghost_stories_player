In chinese culture, we have three calender to reference:
 - `Chinese Country Calendar`, (e.g: 97 年)
 - `Common Era`, (e.g: A.D 2017)
 - `Lunar Calendar`, (e.g 農曆 6 月初一)

Actually, We refer to the `Lunar Calendar` for `Religious Activities`, The lunar month `July` is our ghost month, the Hell will open the door, and ghost will come to human place for travel.
